	* [Latest Release](https://github.com/net-lisias-ksp/StructuralTubing/releases)
* [Source](https://github.com/net-lisias-ksp/StructuralTubing)
* [Change Log](./CHANGE_LOG.md)


## Description

A parts mod, with various structural components to expand on a perceived "hole" in the stock selection, and current offerings from other modders. Also, other random things we find useful and want to share that happen to be of a structural or simple nature.


## INSTALLATION

1. Copy into, or Merge with GameData folder in KSP Directory. 
2. Enjoy

Be sure to make use of the various offset and rotation tools to fully take advantage of these parts. And autostruts. Credit to SpannerMonkey(smce) for pretty much doing all the tricky stuff, and offering to help to begin with. It would have taken me a week or better to figure out what he did in a day. At this point, I've just dicked around with blender a bit, and nitpicked some configs. 
He da real MVP.

### DONT WANT TEXTURE SWITCH?
No big deal, just delete the folder `DKSalvage/Parts/FStextureSwitch2Textures`.

### DONT WANT TWEAKSCALE?
Easy enough. Just delete the file `DKSalvage/Tweakscale.cfg`.

### OTHERWISE STOCK INSTALL?
Then you probably don't need ModuleManager. It, among other things, just helps mods talk to eachother instead of yelling over eachother. If this is the only mod you run, then you will do just fine without ModuleManager. Just delete it.

In this case, it's only packaged to help Tweakscale and Firespitter modules work together.

### Dependencies
* FireSpitter
* TweakScale
* Module Manager
