# Structural Tubing :: Changes

* 2016-1210: 1.0.6 (DrunkenKerbonaut) for KSP 1.2 
	+ If you liked it, then you should have put a ring on it
	+ Toiroids! Toruses. A Torum? We've got rings, people.
		- 0.625m - tweakscale from .3125 to 1.25
		- 1.25m - tweakscale from .625 to 2.5
		- 2.5m - tweakscale from 1.25 to 3.75
		- Furthermore, they have a buttload of nodes. And should you find you want even MORE nodes, see the config file. If you use them for fuel stacks, be sure to toggle crossfeed on. Their collision mesh closely follows the visual model, so engines can thrust through them. However, intakes are still occluded by them, likely a node stack behavior, so idk. In some cases, a little offset fixes this. 
	+ Tech levels changed.
		- Previously all parts were under "composites", a Tier7 tech level. They	have all been adjusted with regards to game balance and part complexity.
		- Or just my whim. Either way, 
	+ THIS MAY FUCK UP YOUR CAREER SAVE!
		- (unless you are from the future)
		- dont update until you've reached the "meta-materials" node. That's 550 science. You could wipe your butt on Ike and mail the tissue home for 550 science points. Also, R&D costs have been adjusted to follow suit.
		- A more in-depth explanation can be seen in `TechTreeChanges.txt`.
	+ Test Criteria added to all parts.
		- They can now be the subject of such menial contracts as "Test the 5m tube on escape trajectory out of Vall", and other such jewels. Have fun!
	+ Added stack symmetry to the tubular platform.
		- Sorry I didnt do this to begin with. It now pairs attachments between the	long sides, and their nodes. I've seen some weird behavior from this when in airplane-style symmetry, and trying to connect to the fore and aft 	nodes. If I find a better solution, I will employ it. In the interim, you can disbale it in the config file. I've left directions there.
