# Structural Tubing :: Change Log

* 2016-1210: 1.0.6 (DrunkenKerbonaut) for KSP 1.2 
	+ If you liked it, then you should have put a ring on it
	+ Toiroids! Toruses. A Torum? We've got rings, people.
		- 0.625m - tweakscale from .3125 to 1.25
		- 1.25m - tweakscale from .625 to 2.5
		- 2.5m - tweakscale from 1.25 to 3.75
		- Furthermore, they have a buttload of nodes. And should you find you want even MORE nodes, see the config file. If you use them for fuel stacks, be sure to toggle crossfeed on. Their collision mesh closely follows the visual model, so engines can thrust through them. However, intakes are still occluded by them, likely a node stack behavior, so idk. In some cases, a little offset fixes this. 
	+ Tech levels changed.
		- Previously all parts were under "composites", a Tier7 tech level. They	have all been adjusted with regards to game balance and part complexity.
		- Or just my whim. Either way, 
	+ THIS MAY FUCK UP YOUR CAREER SAVE!
		- (unless you are from the future)
		- dont update until you've reached the "meta-materials" node. That's 550 science. You could wipe your butt on Ike and mail the tissue home for 550 science points. Also, R&D costs have been adjusted to follow suit.
		- A more in-depth explanation can be seen in `TechTreeChanges.txt`.
	+ Test Criteria added to all parts.
		- They can now be the subject of such menial contracts as "Test the 5m tube on escape trajectory out of Vall", and other such jewels. Have fun!
	+ Added stack symmetry to the tubular platform.
		- Sorry I didnt do this to begin with. It now pairs attachments between the	long sides, and their nodes. I've seen some weird behavior from this when in airplane-style symmetry, and trying to connect to the fore and aft 	nodes. If I find a better solution, I will employ it. In the interim, you can disbale it in the config file. I've left directions there.
* 2016-1209: 1.0.5 (DrunkenKerbonaut) for KSP 1.2 (No Binary Available)
	+ You're Gonna have a Ball
	+ 4 new tube sections, courtesy of SpannerMonkey(smce).
		- 250cm straight
		- 300cm straight
		- 500cm straight
		- Another H, but different. You'll see.
	+ Some new textures for Firespitter users
		- thanks to BureauJaeger.
	+ A new ball valve item for those that use these for plumbing. 		- I kinda wish I had made the valve before allowing crossfeed on every part. Oh well, I've left that alone, so no broken .craft files, or ships that cant access their fuel tanks. That would suck.
	+ R.I.P. John Glenn
* 2016-1205: 1.0.4 (DrunkenKerbonaut) for KSP 1.2 (No Binary Available)
	+ X Marks The Spot
	+ A new "X" hub, or four-way, or cross... super helpful little part.
		- spanner is rockin and rollin on these parts.
	+ A tubular platform, with a mesh/grate inset. good for rover bases.
		- my first part, all by myself! woohoo!
* 2016-1202: 1.0.3 (DrunkenKerbonaut) for KSP 1.2 (No Binary Available)
	+ Tee Time
	+ 4 new parts, various tees.
* 2016-1130: 1.0.2 (DrunkenKerbonaut) for KSP 1.2 (No Binary Available)
	+ I'm a Doofus
	+ 2 new parts - 1x1m "H", and .5x.5m 180
		- Credit to SpannerMonkey(smce).
	+ FSTextureSwitch fixed.
		- Thanks BureauJager and SpannerMonkey(smce).
	+ Tweakscale support added.
		- All parts set to "free", so scaling is by percentage.
	+ ModuleManager.2.7.5 included.
		- (CC Share-Alike License - credit to sarbian, et al.)
		- It fixed the Tweakscale issue (upgrading from 2.6.x) so i dunno.
	+ Agency "DK Salvage" fleshed out a bit more. 
		- *SHOULD* offer contracts in career mode.
	+ Crossfeed Toggles on all parts.
	+ Added "grey.png" back to the FSTextureSwitch modules. (oops)
* 2016-1129: 1.0.1 (DrunkenKerbonaut) for KSP 1.2 (No Binary Available) 
	+ Experimental Build
	+ Consider this an experimental build because only half of the added functionality is working correctly. I'm done working on it for tonight, but didnt want to hold back what DOES work.
* 2016-1125 : 1.0 (DrunkenKerbonaut) for KSP 1.2 (No Binary Available)
	+ Initial Release
	+ Eight tube sections (Elbows, straights, "H" hubs....)
	+ Texture Switch Support (camo and other cool shiz)
	+ Agency and Flag (Kinda janky, may revisit)
