# Structural Tubing :: Change Log

* 2016-1209: 1.0.5 (DrunkenKerbonaut) for KSP 1.2 (No Binary Available)
	+ You're Gonna have a Ball
	+ 4 new tube sections, courtesy of SpannerMonkey(smce).
		- 250cm straight
		- 300cm straight
		- 500cm straight
		- Another H, but different. You'll see.
	+ Some new textures for Firespitter users
		- thanks to BureauJaeger.
	+ A new ball valve item for those that use these for plumbing. 		- I kinda wish I had made the valve before allowing crossfeed on every part. Oh well, I've left that alone, so no broken .craft files, or ships that cant access their fuel tanks. That would suck.
	+ R.I.P. John Glenn
* 2016-1205: 1.0.4 (DrunkenKerbonaut) for KSP 1.2 (No Binary Available)
	+ X Marks The Spot
	+ A new "X" hub, or four-way, or cross... super helpful little part.
		- spanner is rockin and rollin on these parts.
	+ A tubular platform, with a mesh/grate inset. good for rover bases.
		- my first part, all by myself! woohoo!

		- Credit to SpannerMonkey(smce).
	+ FSTextureSwitch fixed.
		- Thanks BureauJager and SpannerMonkey(smce).
	+ Tweakscale support added.
		- All parts set to "free", so scaling is by percentage.
